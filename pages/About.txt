👋🏻 Hello. I’m Brad Lauster and this is my blog.

🗽 I grew up in upstate New York, and after college, moved to California, where I lived in Sacramento, Palo Alto, San Francisco, and Santa Barbara. In 2010, I moved to Hong Kong and then spent seven years in New York City.

🌁 These days, I'm back in San Francisco, where I live with my wife, [Jessica](https://www.instagram.com/jesikakim/), and our huge cat, [Mewzi](https://www.instagram.com/hugemewzi/). 

💪🏼 I recently started a new job as the Director of User Experience at a pre-launch startup. In the past, I’ve worked at [Intel](https://www.intel.com), [Stanford University](https://www.stanford.edu), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/), [AppFolio](https://www.appfolio.com), [Bindo](https://bindopos.com) (a company I co-founded), [Equinox](https://www.equinox.com), [WW](https://ww.com) (formerly Weight Watchers), and [Clover](https://www.clover.com).

🍣 I love backpacking, rock climbing, riding bikes and being in and on the water. I'm also a food enthusiast, and a public transportation nerd.

✉️ I’d love to hear from you, so if you’re inclined, you can reach me on Twitter at [@bradlau](https://twitter.com/bradlau) or by emailing [yo.bradlau@icloud.com](mailto:yo.bradlau@icloud.com).
