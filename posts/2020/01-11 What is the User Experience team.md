# ðŸ˜Ž What is the User Experience team?

The User Experience team is responsible for the overall experience that the companyâ€™s users have with its products and services. 

That said, User Experience is not a role, it's an organization. 

Therefore, we don't hire User Experience (UX) practitioners - there is no such thing. User Experience is made of teams focused on: 
- Customer Service
- Product & Service Design
- Research & User Testing
- UX Writing & Content Strategy
