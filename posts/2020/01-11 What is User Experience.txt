Over the years, I’ve held several different titles in many organizations in many different companies.  

User Experience is a group on the org chart. Design is one of the teams in that group. Other teams in the user experience group include content, customer service, and experience research.

The User Experience team is responsible for the overall experience that the company’s users have with its products and services. 

That said, User Experience is not a role, it's an organization. 

Therefore, we don't hire User Experience (UX) practitioners - there is no such thing. User Experience is made of teams focused on: 
- Customer Service
- Product & Service Design
- Research & User Testing
- UX Writing & Content Strategy
