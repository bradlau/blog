# ðŸ’» Mercury OS by Jason Yuan

[Mercury OS](https://www.mercuryos.com) is a beautifully executed  application of the design principles that [Jef Raskin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jef_Raskin) wrote about 18 years ago in [*The Humane Interface*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Humane_Interface), including modelessness, monotony/habituation, universal undo, elimination of distractions, and an end to stand-alone applications.

[Jason Yuan](https://twitter.com/jasonyuandesign), the Santa Monica-based designer responsible for the project, has created a compelling vision for how one might accomplish modern computer-based tasks using a humane computing environment designed for tablet-computer hardware. 

Thereâ€™s obviously still a lot to think through, such as how would one design user interfaces or code software on the system? The answer may lie in how Yuan incorporates a zooming user interface â€“ one of the most intriguing ideas that Raskin put forth, and an idea that Yuan has not yet addressed â€“ into Mercury OS. 

Itâ€™s been a while since Iâ€™ve seen such a thoughtful, modern take on the design principles in The Humane Interface. I hope Yuan continues to collaborate and iterate on his vision, because what heâ€™s presented so far is pretty exciting.
