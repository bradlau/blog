#  👋🏻 Welcome to bradlau.blog

Well, here I go again with another blog experiment. I’ve been playing around with lightweight blogging tools for a while now and finally decided to commit to occasionally writing when I found [blot.im](https://blot.im), mainly because it’s just so damn simple. 

I began writing on the web in 2000, before [Ghost](https://ghost.org), before [Wordpress](https://wordpress.com), before [Movable Type](https://www.movabletype.com), and even before [Greymatter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greymatter_(software)). These days, rolling your own site using modern technology is so complicated that the idea of it just doesn’t feel fun anymore. 

I’m certainly not the first person to long for the days of linking HTML files by hand and sending them to the web server via plain old FTP. So, when I stumbled on blot – a blogging tool that doesn’t even have an authoring interface – I finally felt like I couldn’t make any more excuses about not publishing more often. 

So here we are! The independent web is in resurgence, and I intend to be a part of it. Welcome.
